## Problem

Choosing the right payment gateway in Brazil can be surprisingly complex. Each provider (like Stripe, Mercado Pago, PagSeguro, etc.) offers different transaction fees based on payment method (credit card, PIX, boleto, etc.), settlement time, and amount.

## Solution

**LF3M** is a simple calculator that helps merchants, developers, and product teams quickly identify the lowest fee for a given payment amount and method. Just input the value and payment method, and it compares fees across gateways.

This tool is useful for:

- Comparing dynamic transaction fees
- Identifying the most cost-effective gateway based on real-world scenarios
- Increasing visibility into hidden or method-dependent charges
